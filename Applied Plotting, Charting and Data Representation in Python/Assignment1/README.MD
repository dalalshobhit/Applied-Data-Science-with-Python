This is a mini project/assignment to visualize temperature of a particular region using data from NOAA dataset. 

In this project, I have visualized 2 line chart and a scatter plot in one chart. 2 line charts represent the record high 
and low temperatures measured in a specific region in the period of 10 years (2005-2014). 
Scatter plot visualizes the temperature recordings of 2015 which breaks the previous record highs and record lows of last 10 
years.

I have used Matplotlib library in Python to draw this visualizations.
